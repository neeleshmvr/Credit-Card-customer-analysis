# Credit-Card-customer-analysis
Codebasics resume project challenge 8
The project was about analyzing the credit card 💳payment data of customers across various categories for MITRON bank Product strategy team to launch a new type of credit card.

I used the following tools for this project:

Power BI (the ultimate data visualization tool 📊)

MS Excel (the classic spreadsheet software 📝)

ChatGPT (the amazing chatbot generator 🗣️)

Tome AI (Used for Presentation)

MS PowerPoint (the powerful presentation creator 🎥)



Some of the key metrics that I used to analyze the credit card data were:

Income utilization percentage (to measure how much of their income they spent on credit card payments 💰)

Total credit card spends (to see how much money they spent on different categories 🛒)

Credit card usage difference by marital status (to compare how married and single customers used their credit cards differently 💘)

Age group vs category of usage (to understand how age influenced their spending preferences 🧑‍🦳)

Credit card spend by occupation (to analyze how their jobs affected their spending habits 👩‍💻) and many more



I discovered some fascinating insights from the data, such as:



- The 25 to 34 and 35 to 45 age groups are the biggest spenders on credit cards 💳, so they should be the primary target for the new card types.

- The 25 to 34 age group is more practical and balanced 🧘, spending more on bills, groceries, electronics, and travel. They would appreciate a reward card that gives them points for their essential expenses and leisure activities.

- The 35 to 45 age group is more responsible and health-conscious 🏥, spending more on bills, health, entertainment, and apparel. They would benefit from a reward card that offers them discounts on their medical bills and fashion purchases.

- The above 45 age group is more mature and settled 🏠, spending more on groceries, travel, electronics, and entertainment. They would enjoy a cashback card that gives them cash back on their daily needs and vacation plans.

- The business owners across all age groups are more ambitious and entrepreneurial 💼, spending more on electronics, travel, entertainment, and apparel. They would prefer a business card that provides them flexibility in their payment options and access to exclusive deals and networking events.
